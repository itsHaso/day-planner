# day-planner

## I further used my knowledge to finish this day planner web application I used te jquery knowledge I learned to make this app a little bit easier.

## I wanted to build this to test my jquery knowledge and have a day planner to save what I wanted to do during that time block.

## to use the application all you have to do is type what you need to do at that time block and just click the save icon and just delete whats saved inside of the box to open it up for your next task.

^ what you see when you first open up the app.

^ one of the time blocks green means its in the futre red means it's in the present and currently going on, grey means it's in the past. The blue icon is the save button each time block gets its own save button.
